OVERVIEW:

The parcel delivery system is a crucial component of modern logistics, responsible for ensuring the efficient and timely delivery of goods to customers. This project seeks to design and develop a robust and efficient parcel delivery system utilizing the C++ programming language. By joining the power of various data structures and algorithms, the system aims to optimize performance and streamline the delivery process. The system will manage parcel sorting, routing, and tracking, enabling real-time monitoring and updates. It will also incorporate features for efficient route planning, reducing delivery times and costs. The project's objective is to create
a scalable and reliable system, capable of handling a high volume of parcels and ensuring timely delivery to customers. By leveraging C++'s performance capabilities and algorithmic efficiency, the system will set a new standard for parcel delivery systems.

OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient parcel delivery system using C++ programming language, incorporating various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, BST, and graphs. The specific goals include:

1. Designing and implementing data structures to manage parcels, delivery routes, and
delivery personnel efficiently.

3. Developing algorithms for route optimization, parcel tracking, and resource allocation.
  
4. Integrating real-time monitoring and tracking features for improved visibility and
transparency.

5. Enhancing scalability and flexibility to accommodate varying parcel volumes and
delivery demands.

KEY FEATURES:

1. Parcel Management: Implement data structures like linked lists for efficient storage and retrieval of parcel information and Enable operations for adding, removing, and updating parcel details.
  
2. Route Optimization: Utilize binary search trees (BST) or graphs for optimizing delivery routes based on distance and time constraints. Develop algorithms such as Dijkstra's for route planning and optimization.

3. Resource Allocation: Use stacks and queues to manage delivery personnel and vehicle scheduling.

4. Tracking: Develop mechanisms for real-time tracking of parcel status and delivery personnel.
